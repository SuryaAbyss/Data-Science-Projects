## 📁 1. DraftVision: NBA Player Success Analysis (1989–2021)

**Overview**  
This project explores NBA Draft data from 1989 to 2021 to uncover trends in player performance, draft value, and career statistics. Using advanced data visualization techniques, we investigate whether draft pick position correlates with long-term success.

**Key Highlights**
- 3D scatter plots of points scored vs. year and draft pick  
- Violin plots comparing top 3 picks  
- Value Over Replacement (VORP) and Box Plus Minus by pick  
- Interactive animations showing performance across years

**Tools Used:** `pandas`, `plotly`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`

## 📁 3. PredCrim: Forecasting Calgary Crime Trends with LSTM

**Overview**  
A machine learning and forecasting project that uses Calgary crime data (2018–2024) to analyze community-level crime patterns and predict future crime trends using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network.

**Key Highlights**
- Community-wise and category-wise crime heatmaps  
- Monthly and yearly trend analysis  
- Built and trained an LSTM time-series model for crime forecasting  
- Recommendations for proactive resource deployment based on predictions

**Tools Used:** `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `TensorFlow/Keras`
