# CrimeCast: Predicting Calgary Crime Trends with LSTM

## 📌 Overview
**CrimeCast** is a data science and deep learning project aimed at analyzing and predicting monthly crime trends across Calgary communities. Using publicly available data from the City of Calgary (2018–2024), this project explores crime patterns and leverages an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network for time-series forecasting.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Understand historical crime patterns across Calgary communities.
- Visualize and interpret community-wise and category-wise crime distributions.
- Build a neural network model to predict future crime counts.
- Support proactive crime prevention through data-driven forecasting.
